   1: The Kourliner is part of the Hypberbole information management
   system.

   2: The Koutliner produces hierarchically structered files
      consisting of trees of cells.

    2.1: A Cell is an element of the outline which has its own display
         label and unique, permanent identifier (idstamp).

    2.2: Idstamps support the creation of hyperlinks to cells which
         are maintained as the structure of the outline changes.

   3: Starting a Koutline:

    3.1: First things first, go ahead and create a file that has the
         extension ".ktol". It should start with the 1. at the
         top. You'll just go ahead and add some text to that first
         cell, and when you are ready to add another cell just use {C-j}.

    3.2: Using {C-j} launches a new cell as a sibling after the
         current cell. To add a cell that is a non-negative prefix
         argument, use {C-u C-j} or {C-c a} which will add the cell as
         a child of the current cell. Examples of this are used
         above. Using {C-j} on 1. creates 2. whereas using {C-u C-j}
         on 2. creates 2a. From there though, we use {C-j} again to
         create 2b.

    3.3: Now that we know how to create more cells and add a child to
         the current cell, lets talk about the autonumbering. Full
         auto-numbering in Augment (1a2) or legal (1.1.2) formats. You
         can change the format by using {C-c C-l} and select and
         option. For the purpose of this I am using the legal format
         because I find it easier to refer to, but feel free to use
         whichever you are more comfortable with.

    3.4: Great, we got our auto-numbering how we want it, let's talk
         label seperators. By default the Koutliner seperates labels
         from cell contents by two spaces. If you would like to change
         the serperator for the current outline, use {C-c M-l}. Go
         ahead and try that out and change it to ": " (no quotation
         marks). Feel free to change it back if you'd like, or change
         it to anything else! Now let's say you really like having the
         seperator being ": ", and would like that to be the default
         for all Koutliner files from now on, you can change that with
         {C-u C-c M-l}.

    3.5: We've covered how to create cells, change the numbering and
         change the seperators, now it's time to talk about how to delete
         cells. To test this out, create a child of this cell {C-u C-j},
         and when it takes you to that cell you realize that you really
         don't need it. Well, luckily deleting it is as simple as {C-c
         C-k}. Go ahead and run that, and the cell will be deleted!

    3.6: Now lets say you simply want to get rid of the contents of a
         cell without getting rid of the cell as a whole. Go ahead and
         run {C-u C-c k}. You don't want to delete all the contents of
         the cell, just from that cursor to the end of it? Well
         Koutliner has got you covered with {C-c k}! 

    3.7: Sometimes you don't want to delete a cell, you just want to
         move the position of it so your Koutline has a better
         flow. Let's go ahead and test this by creating two children
         of our current cell. With {C-u C-j} then {C-j}.
         

     3.7.1: Secondly we want this cell second.

     3.7.2: Firstly, we want this cell first. To make that happen we
            use {C-c m} which will prompt us with which cell we want
            to move, and which cell we want afterwards. Go ahead and
            change the positions of these two cells.
